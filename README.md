# PiG-Game
Simple implementation of the Pig Game in JavaScript.

The Pig Game is a turn-based game where two players roll a die, and accumulate points in their score based on the outcome of the roll. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.

Game Rules
The game is played with a single die. On each turn, a player rolls the die as many times as they want, adding up the result of each roll to their score. However, if they roll a 1, they lose all the points they've accumulated on their turn, and their turn ends.

To keep the points they've accumulated on a turn, a player can choose to "hold", which adds their current turn score to their total score, and ends their turn. The game continues in this fashion, with players taking turns rolling the die until one of them reaches a score of 100.

How to Play
To play the Pig Game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game will load automatically, and you will be prompted to enter the names of the two players. Once you have done so, click the "New Game" button to start a new game.

On each turn, the active player will be highlighted in yellow. To roll the die, simply click the "Roll" button. The result of the roll will be displayed, and if the player rolled a 1, their turn will end automatically. Otherwise, the player can choose to roll again, or to hold their current score by clicking the "Hold" button.

The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game. To start a new game, simply click the "New Game" button again.
